# Steam Explore Queue Skipper
Firefox Add-on for skipping the Steam store /explore/ queue.

The add-on uses a content script to skip through the explore queue 3 times and any explore queues started by the user. Its a content script, so it works only if the store.steampowered.com/explore/ tab is open.
